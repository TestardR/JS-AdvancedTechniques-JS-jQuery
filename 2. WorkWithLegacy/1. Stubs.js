// Function Stubs : A stub is a proxy function that legacy code calls instead of the latest version of the function.

// Let's see Draw-Version5
// a Stub Function has to be only one line of code that calls the enhanced version of the original function. 
// It should supply the original default values for newly added parameters.

// Downside : increase the need for internal documentation

// To sum up
//1. Rename original function
//2. Create new function stub
//3. Legacy code calls stub
//4. New code calls new function name
//5. New code calls new function name
//6. Confusing interface for new members
